The book consists of 18 chapters that cover topics such as circuit analysis, network theorems, operational amplifiers, diodes, transistors, digital logic, microprocessors, feedback systems, and power electronics. The book also includes appendices on complex numbers, matrices, Laplace transforms, Fourier series, and Fourier transforms. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to the principles and applications of electrical engineering, with an emphasis on problem-solving skills and practical examples.
 
The book is suitable for students who have a background in calculus, physics, and basic electronics. The book provides clear explanations, detailed derivations, numerous exercises, and illustrative figures. The book also features online resources such as solutions to selected problems, MATLAB codes, and simulation tools. The book is widely used as a reference and a textbook in many engineering courses and programs.
 
Circuits, Devices and Systems is a classic and authoritative text that offers a solid foundation for students who want to learn more about electrical engineering. The book is praised for its clarity, depth, breadth, and relevance to modern technology. The book is also recommended for engineers and professionals who want to refresh their knowledge or update their skills in this field.
  
One of the strengths of the book is its coverage of both analog and digital circuits and systems. The book explains how analog and digital signals are generated, processed, and converted, and how they interact with each other. The book also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each type of circuit and system, and how to choose the best one for a given application. The book also introduces the concepts of noise, distortion, bandwidth, and filtering, and how they affect the performance and quality of signals and systems.
 
Another strength of the book is its integration of theory and practice. The book not only presents the mathematical models and methods for analyzing circuits and systems, but also shows how they are applied to real-world problems and scenarios. The book provides many examples and case studies that illustrate the design, operation, and testing of various circuits and systems. The book also includes several projects that challenge the students to apply their knowledge and skills to design and implement their own circuits and systems.
 
A third strength of the book is its pedagogical features. The book is organized in a logical and coherent manner, with each chapter building on the previous ones. The book uses a consistent notation and terminology throughout, and defines all the terms and symbols clearly. The book also provides summaries, objectives, key points, review questions, and problems at the end of each chapter. The book also offers hints, tips, warnings, and notes to help the students understand the material better.
